## Data Scraping
Details on how data was scraped from granna.com:
- Tools used: BeautifulSoup.

## Data Ingestion
Description of the data ingestion process:
- Methods used to store and retrieve data
- Tools and libraries used: Pandas, Numpy.
- Scripts or notebooks for data ingestion

## Data Validation
Steps to validate the data:
- Handling missing values
- Detecting and removing duplicates
- Ensuring data consistency

## Data Preprocessing
Preprocessing steps performed on the data:
- Normalization/standardization
- Encoding categorical variables
- Handling outliers

## Feature Engineering
Feature engineering techniques applied:
- Feature extraction
- Feature selection
- Creating new features from existing data

## Model Training
Training the machine learning model:
- Models used: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, etc.
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Cross-validation

## Model Evaluation
Evaluating the model performance:
- Metrics used: RMSE, MAE, R-squared
- Validation methods: Train-test split, cross-validation

## Deployment
